# Discord Bot Assistant

This is a bot I made to have a way to communicate with data I scraped without needing to host a server. At first I wanted scrap reddit and twitter for news about important  information as I felt distant with what was happening. So I thought as a way to be able to interact with my scraped data wherever I am I can host a discord bot at home so I can be outside and still obtain information from my scripts on my desktop.

Current features my discord bot does is scrapping data, modal forms to save gym data in chat, phone to desktop imports, and also has a openai chat ai to response on any message sent for any questions or advice I need.

In the future, I want to make a nearby function to find resturants, cafes, or whatever places and return the highest rated given specific conditions like reviews, ratings, and distance.
